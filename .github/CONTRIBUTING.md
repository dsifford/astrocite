# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started

Before you begin working on your new feature or bugfix, please be sure to open an issue about it first if one does not already exist.

This accomplishes a few things...

1. It allows all contributors to be on the same page.
2. It allows contributors to provide feedback on the idea (if the contribution is a feature).
3. It alerts the community of a potential bug and prevents multiple contributors from working on the same thing (if the contribution is a bugfix).

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. `$ npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your PR

## Committing and Pushing changes

Tests are ran automatically on commits and pushes. If any failures should occur, the commit or push will be aborted.

If this happens to you, just fix whatever problem is causing the tests to fail and try again.

## Help needed

Please check out the [the open issues][issues].

Also, please watch the repo and respond to questions/bug reports/feature requests! Thanks!
